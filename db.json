By jumping out of bed and rushing through tasks, we allow life to happen to us instead of creating a vision for how we want our day to look.

Your life is happening to you, instead of becoming something you can control and design.",

You’ve purchased the new car, finished the novel or earned a promotion at work. These things are done instead of in progress. Viewing a completed accomplishment is the difference between hoping for something to happen and using goal visualization to actually manifest it.",

Many practice mindfulness through meditation, utilizing its strengths to deal with anxiety and develop a richer, more peaceful inner and outer life. By learning how to visualize your goals, you aren’t just accelerating your own success and growth – you’re learning how to ease the impact of fear and concern."
